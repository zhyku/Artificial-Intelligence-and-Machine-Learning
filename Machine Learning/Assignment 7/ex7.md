K-Means Clustering Algorithm

  In the exercise, the K-means algorithm will be implemented and used for image compression. An example 2D dataset will help build intuition of how the K-means algorithm works. After that, the K-means algorithm will be used for image compression by reducing the number of colors occurring in an image to only those most common. You will be using ex7.m for this part of the exercise.

Dimensionality Reduction with Principal Component Analysis

 In this part of the exercise, dimensionality reduction is performed using principal component analysis (PCA). First, experiment with an example 2D dataset, which has one direction of large variation and one of smaller variation, to get intuition on how PCA works, and then use it on a bigger dataset of 5000 face images. The provided script, ex7 pca.m, will help step through the first half of the exercise. In the next part, visualize what happens when you use PCA to reduce the data from 2D to 1D.
