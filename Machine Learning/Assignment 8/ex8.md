Anomaly Detection

  In this exercise, anomaly detection algorithm is implemented to detect anomalous behavior in server computers. The features measure the throughput (mb/s) and latency (ms) of response of each server. While the servers were operating, m = 307 behavior examples were collected, generating an unlabeled dataset, of which the vast majority are suspected to be normal (non-anomalous) examples with a few exceptions.

Recommender Systems

  In this part, the collaborative filtering learning algorithm will be implemented and applied to a dataset of movie ratings. This dataset consists of ratings on a scale of 1 to 5. The dataset has nu = 943 users, and nm = 1682 movies.

  In the next part, you can enter your own movie preferences and the algorithm returns personalized movie recommendations. The next part of the script computes the ratings for all the movies and users and displays the movies that it recommends, according to ratings that were entered earlier.
