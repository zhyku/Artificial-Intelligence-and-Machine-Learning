  The first part of this exercise implements a logistic regression model to predict whether a student gets admitted into a university.

  Suppose you are the administrator of a university department and want to determine each applicant's chance of admission based on their results in two exams. You have historical data from previous applicants that you can use as a training set for logistic regression. For each training example, you have the applicant's scores on two exams and the decision of admission. The task is to build a classification model that estimates an applicant's probability of admission based on the scores from those two exams.

  The second part of this exercise implements regularized logistic regression to predict whether microchips from a fabrication plant pass quality assurance (QA).

  During QA, each microchip goes through various tests to ensure it functions correctly. Suppose you are the factory's product manager and you have the results of two different tests for some microchips. From these tests, you seek to determine whether the microchips should be accepted or rejected. To help you make this decision, a dataset of test results on past microchips has been provided, from which you can build a logistic regression model.
