Regularized Linear Regression, Bias, and Variance

  The first half of the exercise implements regularized linear regression to predict the amount of water flowing out of a dam using the change in water level in a reservoir. In the next half, some diagnostics of debugging learning algorithms shall be reviewed, and the effects of bias vs variance will be examined.
