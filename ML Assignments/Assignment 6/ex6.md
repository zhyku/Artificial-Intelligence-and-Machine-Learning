Support Vector Machines

  In the first half of this exercise, support vector machines (SVMs) are implemented with various example 2D datasets. Experimenting with these datasets will provide intuition of how SVMs work and how to use a Gaussian kernel with SVMs.

   In the next half of the exercise, support vector machines are used to build a spam classifier.
