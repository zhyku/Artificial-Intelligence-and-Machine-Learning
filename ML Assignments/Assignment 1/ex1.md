This exercise implements linear regression with one variable to predict profits for a food truck.

  Suppose you are the CEO of a restaurant franchise and are considering new cities to open a new outlet. The chain already has trucks in various cities and you have data for profits and populations from the cities. You would like to use this data to help you select which city to expand to next. The file ex1data1.txt contains the dataset for our linear regression problem, where the first column contains the population of a city and the second column is the profit a food truck makes in that corresponding city (negative values indicate loss).
